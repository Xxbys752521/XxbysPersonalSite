# About this site

Welcome to my digital garden ðŸŒ±. This site functions as a blog/portfolio, a place to share code and thoughts. Opinions are my own.

I learnt how to build this site from the most awesome people in the community:

- [Timlrx's Next.js and Tailwind CSS template](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) :Template starter where I bootstrapped the project.
- [Einar GuÃ°jÃ³nsson](https://www.einargudni.com/) :Now page, navigation style, animations and much more.
